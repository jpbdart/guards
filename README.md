# GUARDS

**GUARDS** (Global Unified Approach for Reliable Data Stream Security) is a prototype framework used to parse NFSv3 or NFSv4 using DFDL to validate the network packets before they reach the NFS server.

>**NOTE**: This is the repo for GUARDS work; we are currently moving code from our development repos to a unified "product" repo here. As we move code to the repo, this file will be updated with the latest devlopments.

## Directories

The DFDL directory holds the parser code as well as *sbt* data to be able to test the DFDL code independently of the daemon.
